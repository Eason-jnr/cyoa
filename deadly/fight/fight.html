        <p>You make your decision, Running is for cowards. You may not remember who you are but, you won’t just let this guy walk all over you.</p>
    
        <p>Upon making your decision the world turns gray and freezes. Not even you are able to move, you feel a burning sensation in your chest several embers eager to settle within your very core, yet only one can settle at a time.</p>

        <!-- Hidden Buff/Debuff Sections -->
        <div id="buff-enrage" class="hidden">An ember settles into your soul, You felt it-an unmistakable surge of power coursing through your veins. 
            You somehow knew that Every attack from here on out would be devastating, far beyond normal limits. Time then slowly resumes as the world regains its colour. 
            Without warning, he charged, his body glowing as if ready to burst.
            <br>
            The man lunged at you, his hand glowing as he reached out, intent on touching you with that explosive force. But for some reason you were faster, your instincts sharpened by the raw power fueling you.
             You ducked under his outstretched arm and drove your fist into his ribs. Crack! The force of your punch sent him flying backward, skidding across the ground, his body leaving a trail of rubble in its wake. 
            He groaned, struggling to get back to his feet. That single punch had landed with a power far beyond what you had anticipated-he wasn't prepared for the intensity of your attack, and neither were you.
            You barely felt the pain in your knuckles. Rather than continue to be surprised you quickly collected your wits before you charged forward, fists raised. He managed to stand, his body shimmering with energy, but it was too late. 
            You swung again, this time aiming for his face.
            <br>
            <br>
            Boom! His body jolted as your fist connected, the sheer force of the blow magnified several times over. His head snapped back violently, and the energy around him flared before dissipating, unable to contain the damage. 
            He stumbled, dazed, blood trickling down from his nose and his mouth, several of his teeth broken.
            But you didn't stop.  You pressed the advantage. With a swift kick to his midsection, you sent him sprawling, and the ground beneath him cracked from the impact as he bounced only for him to crash into the side of a building. The explosion he had been charging fizzled, the energy flickering out, as he lost control of his powers.
            <br>
            You made your way towards him, desperate, he extended his hand toward you again, summoning the last of his strength, his palm glowing with unstable energy. He was going to try one last desperate attack. 
            But you saw how telegraphed and slow he was, You grabbed his arm mid-swing, seeing him glow brighter upon contact, in one brutal motion, you twisted it, pulling him close.
             Then, with a primal roar, you flung him over your head then quickly slammed him into the ground with both hands, creating a loud explosion and a deep crater. 
             The earth shook beneath the force of the impact, all that was left of him was the hand you grabbed hold of, the rest of him was nothing but a red paste of crushed organs on the ground

    <!--Hidden Regen-->
        <div id="buff-regen" class="hidden"> You feel an ember settle deep in your soul, you instinctively felt that this ember, could heal you of anything amd everything if and only if youre alive.
            The world resumes as the man cockily walked towards you, your eyes move around for anything resembling a weapon. without warning he lunges towards you aiming at your face, you throw quickly throw a right hook to retaliate, it connects with his jaw, slightly disoreinting him, but not completely throwing off his lunge.
            His palm grazed your lower torso, and in an instant, an explosion of force sent you flying. The blast tore through your flesh splitting your torso from you legs, as youre thrown back.
            Your back hits a wall halting your momentum, making you cough out globs of blood. 
            For a moment, the agony was overwhelming. Your ribs, your lungs screamed in protest, your vision blurred, but then-you felt it. 
            That deep, familiar ember in your body. Your skin began to knit itself back together, the searing pain in your chest and the torn up half of your torso easing with every passing second. 
            Blood dried up, muscles reformed, bones realigned with a sickening crunch, but you barely winced..
            <br>
            Within seconds you can feel your legs, this prompts you stand on your feet and look down at yourself  in surprise.
            You see a symbol on your chest and the realize even that your new regenerated lower half is still clad in the jumpsuit.
            <div class="regen">
                <img src="images/regen.jpg">
            </div>
            You somehow knew, deep down,  that as long as you were alive, you could heal from anything.
            You barely had time to think about what just happen, to take in the fact that you just recovered from woumds that would have killed a normal person move before he was on you, a frantic expression on his face.
            He slammed into your body before exploding once more sending you hurtling through a crumbling wall, you seem to black out a bit due to the agony youre feeling,
            suddenly you're woken up with a jolt, once again your shattered bones and torn flesh regrow and reknit itself. A sigh of relief escapes your lips, you then remember the situation at hand, you look around spotting a metal rod on the ground beside you.
            <br>
            "What?" Your gaze travels to the man, his expression shocked, but he quickly schools it before lunging at you once more.
            You quickly grip the metal rod then slam to his head, it almost breaks his lunge, almost, because he falls at your feet and then grips your legs before 
            <strong>boom</strong>. The explosion of force from the man tore your lower half off, a scream of agony tears through your lips.
             The world goes dark once more for a moment, as your ears ring . 
             <br>
             <br>
             But it was only for a moment.
             <br>
            <br>
            The symbol on your chest pulse lightly, the ember within your soul recreating your flesh, from bone, to nerves to muscles, far faster than previously.
            The ringing in your ear stops as you hear the man groaning on the floor, you then look at him beforeyour gaze travels to your regenerated lower half, which was still somehow clad in the plain jumpsuit.
            You quickly stood on your feet, staggering a bit, as you grab a brick block beside you.
            Your opponent the man slowly starts crawling back away from you clutching his bleeding head, "..a brute?" you hear him mutter.
            "I dont know what you mean", you said calmly, walking toward him.
            <br>
            His body flared with energy one last time, desperation driving him to attack again. He lunged, hands glowing with unstable power,
            You simply dodged to the side, smashing the brick against his head mid lunge, he fell to the ground screaming clutching his head in pain.
            You, simply grab and slam it into his head once more, he remains on the ground unmoving.

            Upon seeing that symbol You didn’t know how you knew, but you did. All it took was a thought single focus—and you could end this fight. 
            No matter how powerful or invulnerable your opponent was, that mark on his chest had sealed his fate.
            With a thought from you, his lunge was cut short and he fell landing in front of you. 
            The man at your feet was simply dead, he looked fine like nothing was wrong with him, but you knew that all he was now was a corpse.
