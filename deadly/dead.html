        <p>You decide to take the Risk choosing the <strong>Deadly</strong> route, a shiver of excitement, not your own rather the entity's run down your spine</p>

        <p>Without warning the view changes from the gloom darkness of the void of nothingness to what could only be described as a complete wreck of a city. 
            </p>

        <p>You're taken aback by what you see, See? You realize you can finally see, you take in a sharp breathe of air, you can feel the air on your skin the warmth of clothes on your body. Your gaze travels down to see an all black jumpsuit on your body.</p>

        <p>Several screams cut you out of your musing making you lift your head to the source, to what could be described as an apocalyptic scenario. Several buildings with large holes in them, a few torn from their very foundations.</p>

        <p>However the view of a large number of people screaming and attacking each other is what takes the cake. Several rush past you as you stand there still disoriented from the sudden shift in environment. You notice youre not being fazed us they push against your body.</p>

        <p>You hear a scream tears through the air before a blur suddenly crashes in front of you into the panicking crowd with bone shattering force. People are thrown like Ragdolls, their screams cutting short as bodies crumpled under impact. Dust and debris cloudd the street momentarily obscuring the carnage but as it settled the scene became clear. </p>

            <p> A person garbed in a strange outfit one that you may see from comics, torn and bloddy lay in the wreckage of guts and bbone shards, struggling to push themselves up from the crater they'd form in the street. Whoever they were theyre entrance had cost the lives of those unlucky in their path. Mangled bodies littered the ground, their wide eyes staring back in silent horror.  </p>
            
            <p>You stood frozen just a few feet  away and yet close enough to see exactly what ensued. The man, then suddenly drops lifelessly before a voice is heard from a wristband on his hand "Shardstrike deceased" </p>
            
            <p>The few civilians who werent in the pah of the crash begin theyre panic and screams once again. A man bumbs into you before falling on his behind, he looks up at you with a glare "Get fuc-" he pauses, the glare changes to widen eyes before changing to desperation.</p>
            
            <p>"A C-cape?" he mutters almost a whisper "Hero youre a hero arent you?" the title he calls you takes you aback. Cape? Hero? Youre confused why he calls you that.</p>

            <p>"Hero? what do you mean. And Cape?" you voice out in reply. He looks at you, confused at your confusion and points to your chest, "Youre a cape arent you youre using your powers". Your gaze immediately travels to your chest to see just what this man is talking about</p>

            <p> "What ?" youre surprised at what you see a symbol, pulses with a dim glow. "You see, youre a cape, you gotta help me escape this place before they Quarantine here" He says desperately and a little too loudly, other civilians hear and slowly start to crowd you despair and hope etched on their faces.</p>

            <p> "You'll help us ?" a woman says to you as she walks in your space. More desperate voices of the remaining civilians start to plead with you to save them to do something</p>

            <p>"Wait Wait, Quarantine? First he calls me a cape, i dont know what that is then says i have powers, now youre talking about a Quarantine?" You quickly say so youre not crowded as you move back a bit.</p>

            <p>"As far as I'm aware, I just got here, only to see several people die. I don't know what's happening," you say, causing them to pause briefly and look at you with a confused expression </p>
            <p>"The fuck do you mean you dont know" The man from earlier screams in your face. "Cant you see all the destruction? Ziz is fucking attacking the city, the capes are fighting her and losing, if we dont get out, They're gonna Quarantine the entire city. And they do Nothing goes out" He grabs your jumpsuit trying to shake you but you dont budge you dont budge or move an inch which surprises him. </p>

            <p> "Look i dont know what is happeining i dont remember anything" You say then gently push his hands off you. Your words make him look at you strangely before his eyes widen in fear after a few seconds.</p>

            <p>"Shit he's a Ziz bomb" He screams ubruptly trying to shove you away from him once again you remain steadfast,immovable </p>

            <p>You dont kmow what a Ziz bomb is but from how the civilians instanly flee while screaming in fear its nothing good. You then suddenly hear the distant sounds of explosions. Your gaze travels across the delapidated buildings until it meets a crowd of people running. The glow on your chest dims the dies down, upon checking that symbol on your chest is gone leaving just the b plain jumpsuit</p>

            <p>One of the people in the crowd jumps to hold a woman before exploding violently, the shockwave flinging the rest of the crowd away along with a shower of organs and gore. A girl, probably a teenager lands in front of you, her face twisted in agony as she squirms and whimpers you see her clothes tattered and burnt with most of her torso</p>

            <p>You then see her eyes roll to the back of her head, her fingers dig into her skull then suddenly her body jerked violently as tho she'd beeen shocked back to life. You then see several tiny sparks around the girl as shhe spasms before she falls unconcious</p>

            <p>"Holyshit that felt great " A deep voice cut you out of your musing as you look to the side, to see a the same guy who you saw explode just recently. 'He's alive?' you think to yourself. </p>

            <p>"Huh? Someone survived" he says looking at you then the girl. No matter you'll die like the rest of them, His body starts to glow his veins orange becoming visible as he sports a grin he the starts walking towards you.</p>

            <p>You think, from what you saw, he can explode upon making contact with his target. If you let him get closer he may exploded and kill you, you could probably outrun him.  The girl passed out at your feet will definitely die, Will you try to protect her? You could definitely find a way to lure him away from the girl.  Or will you try to do the stupid thing a fight? You seemed to have a power from your ealier interaction with those people.</p>
