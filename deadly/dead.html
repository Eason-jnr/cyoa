        <p>You decide to take the Risk choosing the <strong>Deadly</strong> route, a shiver of excitement, not your own rather the entity's run down your spine</p>

        <p>Without warning the view changes from the gloom darkness of the void of nothingness to what could only be described as a complete wreck of a city. 
            </p>

        <p>You're taken aback by what you see, See? You realize you can finally see, you take in a sharp breathe of air, you can feel the air on your skin the warmth of clothes on your body. Your gaze travels down to see an all black jumpsuit on your body.</p>

        <p>Several screams cut you out of your musing making you lift your head to the source, to what could be described as an apocalyptic scenario. Several buildings with large holes in them, a few torn from their very foundations.</p>

        <p>However the view of a large number of people screaming and attacking each other is what takes the cake. Several rush past you as you stand there stilldisoriented from the sudden shift in environment. You notice youre not being fazed us they push against your body.</p>

        <p>You hear a scream tears through the air before a blur suddenly crashes in front of you picking up dust you shield your eyes, then realized the sounds of people rushing past you has halted </p>

            <p> You feel tempted to take the <strong>easy</strong> route. A life of safety, peace, and simplicity. But deep down, you wonder: Will a life without challenge leave you empty? Will you look back with regret at what could have been?</p>
            
            <p><strong>Real</strong>, grounded, and tough. A life where each choice matters, where suffering and joy walk hand-in-hand. But is this balance what you want? Do you have the strength to bear the weight of such a life?</p>
            
            <p>A thrill, not your own pulses through you as you consider the <strong>Deadly</strong> path. Survival will be a battle every day, and danger will lurk around every corner. But you could achieve greatness... or perish in an instant.</p>
            
            <p>There’s something intriguing about this last option. It feels personal, specific, as if this path is tailored for a select few. But what kind of existence is tied to a name you’ve never heard before?</p>
