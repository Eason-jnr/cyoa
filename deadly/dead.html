        <p>You decide to take the Risk choosing the <strong>Deadly</strong> route, a shiver of excitement, not your own rather the entity's run down your spine</p>

        <p>Without warning the view changes from the gloom darkness of the void of nothingness to what could only be described as a complete wreck of a city. 
            </p>

        <p>You're taken aback by what you see, See? You realize you can finally see, you take in a sharp breathe of air, you can feel the air on your skin the warmth of clothes on your body. Your gaze travels down to see an all black jumpsuit on your body.</p>

        <p>Several screams cut you out of your musing making you lift your head to the source, to what could be described as an apocalyptic scenario. Several buildings with large holes in them, a few torn from their very foundations.</p>

        <p>However the view of a large number of people screaming and attacking each other is what takes the cake. Several rush past you as you stand there stilldisoriented from the sudden shift in environment. You notice youre not being fazed us they push against your body.</p>

        <p>You hear a scream tears through the air before a blur suddenly crashes in front of you into the panicking crowd with bone shattering force. People are thrown like Ragdolls, their screams cutting short as bodies crumpled under impact. Dust and debris cloudd the street momentarily obscuring the carnage but as it settled the scene became clear. </p>

            <p> A person garbed in a strange outfit one that you may see from comics, torn and bloddy lay in the wreckage of guts and bbone shards, struggling to push themselves up from the crater they'd form in the street. Whoever they were theyre entrance had cost the lives of those unlucky in their path. Mangled bodies littered the ground, their wide eyes staring back in silent horror.  </p>
            
            <p>You stood frozen just a few feet  away and yet close enough to see exactly what ensued. The man, then suddenly drops lifelessly before a voice is heard from a wristband on his hand "Shardstrike deceased" </p>
            
            <p>The few civilians who werent in the pah of the crash begin theyre panic and screams once again. A man bumbs into you before falling on his behind, he looks up at you with a glare "Get fuc-" he pauses, the glare changes to widen eyes before changing to desperation.</p>
            
            <p>"A C-cape?" he mutters almost a whisper "Hero youre a hero arent you?" the title he calls you takes you aback. Cape? Hero? Youre confused why he calls you that.</p>

            <p>"Hero? what do you mean. And Cape?" you voice out in reply. He looks at you, confused at your confusion and points to your chest, "Youre a cape arent you youre using your powers". Your gaze immediately travels to your chest to see just what this man is talking about</p>

            <p> "What ?" youre surprised at what you see a symbol, pulses with a dim glow. "You see, youre a cape, you gotta help me escape this place before they Quarantine here" He says desperately and a little too loudly, other civilians hear and slowly start to crowd you despair and hope etched on their faces.</p>

            <p> "You'll help us ?" a woman says to you as she walks in your space. More desperate voices of the remaining civilians start to plead with you to save them to do something</p>

            <p>"Wait Wait, Quarantine? First he calls me a cape, i dont know what that is then says i have powers, now youre talking about a Quarantine?" You quickly say so youre not crowded as you move back a bit.</p>

            <p>"As far as I'm aware i just got here, only to see several people die, i dont know what is happeing." You say, this causes them to pause breifly and look at you  with confused face.</p>

            <p>"The fuck do you mean you dont know" The man from earlier screams in your face. "Cant you see all the destruction? Ziz is fucking attacking the city, the capes are fighting her and losing, if we dont get out, They're gonna Quarantine the entire city. And they do Nothing goes out" He grabs your jumpsuit trying to shake you but you dont budge you dont budge or move an inch which surprises him. </p>

            <p>"Look i dont know what is happeining i dont remember anything" You say then gently push his hands off you. Your words make him look at you strangely before his eyes widen in fear after a few seconds.</p>

            <p>"Shit he's a Ziz bomb" He screams ubruptly trying to shove you away from him once again you remain steadfast immovable </p>
