    <h1>Prologue</h1>
    <p1>You suddenly wake up to a black inky void. Nothingness as far as the eye can see. The experience disconcerting , you look down to first check your body, you find nothing. You realize you have no body, no eyes yet can see and no memory of what or who you are.
    </p1>
    <br>
    <p1>You feel a prescence within your being, it feels warm, tingly and disconcerting a blend of foreign feelings in your being</p1>
    <p1>"You've been here for quite a while, and yet you are still sane" You hear? a voice  within you speak. "No matter i have a small task for you, should you accept i will get you out of here" you hear the voice continue, you want to ask who it is, why youre here and even who you are yet nothing comes out. </p1>
    <br>
    <p>You contemplate the over the offer you heard from the voice. With nothing better to do you....</p>
