        <h1>Prologue</h1>
    <p>You suddenly wake up to a black inky void. Nothingness as far as the eye can see. You try to remember how long you've been hereâ€”in this dark, endless void where time and space seem meaningless. 
        Were you someone important? Or was your life as insignificant as a flickering candle in a storm? Memories of a distant past come in fragmented whispers... 
        You think of a family you might have had, or a love lost too soon. None of it seems real anymore
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>You feel a prescence within your being, it feels warm, tingly and disconcerting a blend of foreign feelings in your being</p1>
    <p>"You've been here for quite a while, and yet you are still sane" You hear? a voice  within you speak. "No matter i have a small task for you, should you accept i will get you out of here" you hear the voice continue, you want to ask who it is, why youre here and even who you are yet nothing comes out. </p1>
    <br>
    <p>You contemplate the over the offer you heard from the voice. With nothing better to do you....</p>
